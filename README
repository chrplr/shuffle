This is shuffle, a program to generate random or pseudorandom
permutations.

Shuffle reads lines and outputs them (or a subset of them) in a random
order, possibly with constraints on successive lines.  If no contraint
is specified, all permutations are equiprobable. Otherwise,
constraints can be specified as maximum number of repetitions of
labels in one or several columns of the output, or on the minimum
distance between successive repetitions.


INSTALLATION 
============

Shuffle requires Perl to be installed on your system (cf http://www.cpan.org).
The graphical, interactive version also requires the Tk module for Perl.

To install, just copy in a directory which is in the path 
(e.g. /usr/local/bin).

shuffle.pl
shuffle_tk.pl
distruns.pl

You may have to modify the first line of each script to reflect to
actual location of perl on your system.

RUNNING
=======

On the command-line, type shuffle.pl or shuffle_tk

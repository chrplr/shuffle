<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
Experimental psychologists routinely need to create randomized lists.
A first example is the selection of the material for psycholinguistics
experiments, which typically requires extracting random samples of
words from dictionaries. Another example is that of creating
different randomizations of trials' order for each participant in an
experiment.

<p>
Presenting the stimuli in different random orders to each participant aims to
diminish the impact of list-specific potential between-trials interactions.
Some between-trials interactions arise when series of trials contains long
sequences with similar characteristics; For example, successive trials may
contain stimuli that have similar features, or map systematically onto the
same response. It is known that response times of participants are sensitive
to such local repetitions [<a href="#Luce86" name="CITELuce86"> LuceLuce1986</a>].

<p>
This paper presents <tt>shuffle</tt>, a program designed to extract
random samples and to `quasi-randomize' the order of items in lists,
avoiding long runs of similar items.

<p>

<h2>Installing shuffle</h2>

<p>
The ``shuffle'' package can be freely downloaded from the software page on the
author's web site<a href="#tthFtNtAAB" name="tthFrefAAB"><sup>1</sup></a>. It consists of two
programs: <tt>shuffle</tt> and <tt>shuffle.tk</tt>. The first is meant to be
used from a command line, while the other uses a graphical interface.

<p>
Both programs are written in Perl. Therefore, before using them, an
interpreter for the language Perl must be installed on your computer (cf.
http://www.cpan.org); In addition, the Tk module must be installed if you want
to use the graphical version.

<p>
One of the advantages of having shuffle written Perl, is that it can run under
Linux, MacOSX, Windows... The other is that, if necessary, one can modify the
source code to tune it to ones' needs. ``shuffle'' is distributed under the
terms of the GNU General Public License 2 [<a href="#GPL" name="CITEGPL"> GPLGPL1991</a>].

<p>
Once Perl is working, to install the programs, you need to:

<ol type="1"><p>
<li> copy <tt>shuffle</tt> and <tt>shuffle.tk</tt> in a directory listed in
  the PATH variable (e.g.  <tt>&nbsp;/bin</tt> under Linux, <tt>c://windows</tt>
    under Windows.).</li>
<p>
<li> adapt, if necessary, the first line of each program, to reflect to
  actual location of perl on your system. The original files assume that
  the perl program is located at <tt>/usr/bin/perl</tt>. You may have to
  change this to, for example, <tt>/usr/local/bin/perl</tt> (To locate perl,
  under unix/linux, just type `which perl' on a command line).</li>
</ol>

<p>

<h2>Using `shuffle'</h2>

<p>
<tt>shuffle</tt> can either be used as a command-line utility, or as program with a
graphical interface. New users will probably prefer the version with the
graphical interface, but the command line version has additional options, no
limitation on the size of the input and embodies the unix philosophy of
designing small, portable and efficient tools that can easily be used as
building blocks in more complex programs.  It will therefore appeal more to
advanced users.

<p>
Typing `<tt>shuffle.tk</tt>' on a command line launches the graphical version.

<p>

<center><table border="0"><tr><td></td><td><table border="0"><tr><td><a href="shufftk">Figure</a>
</td></tr></table><!--vbox-->
</td><td>
</td></tr></table><!--hboxt--></center>

<p>
The center of the window features a text area where the original list can be
entered, with one item per line. The list can be edited directly, or pasted
from the clipboard. Alternatively, it can be read from a text file by typing
first the filename in the box entitled `Filename' and then pressing the `Open'
button.<a href="#tthFtNtAAC" name="tthFrefAAC"><sup>2</sup></a>

<p>
Pressing the `shuffle' button shuffles the lines in the text area in a random
order. The ``seed'' box can be used to enter a number which determine the
permutation that will be used. This is useful if one want to apply the same
permutation to several lists. 

<p>
If the ``constraints'' box is empty, all permutations are equiprobable (the
formal demonstration is given below). To avoid certain permutations however,
it is possible to write a series of numbers in this box. This option is
meaningful only when the input text is in tabular format, that is when each
line contains the same number of items separated by spaces. The items in some
or all of the columns may be considered as ``labels'' corresponding to levels
of experimental factors. It is then possible to reject permutations in which
the labels are repeated, across successive lines, more than a fixed number of
times. For example, if one column contains the labels `WORD' or `PSEUDO' to
indicate the level of the factor `LEXICALITY', one may want to avoid
permutations in which, say, more than four lines in row contain the same label
(that is belong to the same level of the factor LEXICALITY).

<p>
The <i>i<sup><span class="roman">th</span></sup></i> number in the constraint box corresponds to the
<i>i<sup><span class="roman">th</span></sup></i> column in the input. When set to '0', there is no
constraints in the relevant column. When set to a positive number, it means the
maximum number of repetitions (across successive lines) in the relevant
column. When set to a negative number, e.g. <font face="symbol">-</font
>n, it means that a least n
lines must separate two occurrences of the same label.

<p>
The latter option is useful to create lists where a small of targets appear in
the middle of a larger number of filler items: on can create a column
containing either the label `TARGET' or 'FILLERxxx' where `xxx' varies for
each filler. If the constraint `-10' is associated to this columns, targets
will be separated by at least 10 fillers.

<p>
The command line utility will be described briefly, supposing the input list
is in a text file named `corpus.txt' in the current working directory. The command:

<pre>
shuffle corpus.txt

</pre>  
prints the lines from <tt>corpus.txt</tt> in a random order. In
order to save this result in a text file, one must use the redirection
operator `<tt>&gt;</tt>': the following command: 

<pre>
shuffle corpus.txt &#62;neworder.txt

</pre>
produces a random permutation of the lines of <tt>corpus.txt</tt> and stores it
in the file <tt>neworder.txt</tt>.

<p>
Often, one does not need a complete permutation, but rather only a
random sample from the original list. The variable 'n', passed as
argument to <tt>shuffle</tt>, permits to specify the maximum number of
output lines:

<pre>
shuffle n=10 corpus.txt

</pre>
yields 10 lines picked at random from <tt>corpus.txt</tt>. The variable
<tt>seed</tt> can also be set on the command line. This can be useful to apply
the same permutation to different files:

<pre>
shuffle seed=123 corpus.txt
shuffle seed=123 corpus2.txt

</pre>

<p>
Finally, to specify constraints on the repetition of labels in columns, one
must pass the variable `constr' on the command line:

<pre>
shuffle constr='0 0 4 -6' corpus.txt

</pre>

<p>
Listing&nbsp;1 shows a few examples of the use of 'shuffle'. Note that in
these examples, 'shuffle' just displays its result. To save it in a
file, one has to use the redirection operator '<tt>&gt;</tt>'.

<p>

<h2>Proof of equiprobability</h2>

<p>
Here is the pseudo-code for the generation of an unconstrained random
permutation:

<p>

<pre>
...read line[1] to line[N]
for i := N downto 2 do swap( line[i], line[random(i)] )
//  remark:  random(i) return a number in the interval [1;i]

</pre>

<p>
We are going to use the recurrence principle to demonstrate that this
algorithm makes all permutations of the lines equiprobable (that is,
each has the probability 1/n!). It helps to note that the
previous code is the iterative equivalent of the following recursive
algorithm:

<p>

<pre>
function perm(n) {
 swap(line[n],line[random(n)])
 if n&#62;1 then perm(n-1) 
}

</pre>

<p>
For a permutation of size 2: line[2] is swapped with either line[1] or
line[2], each case having probability 1/2. Therefore the two
permutations, (1,2) and (2,1), are equiprobable.

<p>
Let us suppose that the algorithm generates equiprobable permutations
up until rank n<font face="symbol">-</font
>1 (that is, any given line has probability 1/n<font face="symbol">-</font
>1
to occur in any given output rank). To generate a permutation of rank
n, the algorithm first swaps line(n) randomly with one of the lines
between 1 and n (therefore each has the same probability, 1/n, to
occur in output rank n), and then applies itself recursively to the
n<font face="symbol">-</font
>1 first elements. By hypothesis, all n-1 elements have equal
probability to be assigned any given output rank between 1 and n-1.
Finally, a given line (with rank between 1 and n) has probability
1/n to be assigned to output rank n and probability (n<font face="symbol">-</font
>1)/n &times;1/(n<font face="symbol">-</font
>1)=1/n to be assigned to any given output rank between 1 and
n<font face="symbol">-</font
>1.

<p>

<h2>Algorithm for constrained permutations</h2>

<p>
A constrained permutation is generated very much in the way a human
would do it by hand. First an unconstrained permutation of the input
lines is generated; then the algorithm checks, from the first line
downward, if all constraints are fulfilled. Every time a line is found
that violates a constraint, the algorithm searches systematically for
an acceptable line further down the list. If such a line is found,
the algorithm swaps it with the line that violated the constraint. If
no acceptable line can be found, the current permutation is abandoned
and a new one is tried. 

<p>
This algorithm is not guaranteed to converge: the constrains may be to
strong, that is, impossible to fullfill. For example, suppose that the
input list is composed of 2/3 of items of type 1, and 1/3 of items
of type 2; if you require that successive lines always be of different
types, then the algorithm will fail. Yet, if half of the items in the
input are of type 1 and half of type 2, then the algorithm will always
find one of the two solutions (permutations that alternate between
types 1 and 2.)

<p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
I wrote shuffle for my own needs. I distribute it in the hope that it can be
useful to others. I do not garantee that it works as intended. I would
appreciate any bug reports, about the programs or the documentation.
